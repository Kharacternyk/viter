# viter
Viter is a terminal emulator written and expandable in Python. It features vim-like modes, keybindings and a status line. Viter is mainly inspired by [Termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite). Viter uses GTK+ VTE widget as the backend (like Termite) and doesn't require any patches to it([unlike Termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite#dependencies)).
